To compile:

1. Go to the build directory (create it if it hasn't been created already).

2. Type cmake ../

3. Make the executable for the desired code file, e.g.:
make hello_world
make member_access
The executable can be found in the subdirectory within the build directory that has the same name as the directory that contains the code file, e.g. in /build/03_fundamentals for hello_world.

4. make clean removes all the executables in all the subdirectories of the build directory.
