To compile:

1. Go to the build directory (create if it hasn't been created already)

2. Type cmake ../

3. Make the executable for the desired code file, e.g.:
make hello_world
make member_access
The executable can be found inside the corresponding subdirectory of each code file, e.g. inside 03_fundamentals for hello_world.

4. make clean removes all the executables in all the subdirectories of the build directory.
